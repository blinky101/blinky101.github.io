# Blinky 101

Blinky101 is a collection of projects that helps you get up to speed with various microcontroller platforms. We have step by step tutorials and guides to help you start developing using open source tools. 

## Microcontrollers

* [lpc11uxx](https://blinky101.github.io/blinky_lpc11uxx/)
* lpc43xx

## Debugging

* Black Magic Probe
* OpenOCD


# What do you need

* Microcontroller developer board or breakout board. The simpler the better. 
* Debugging hardware to get your code on the microcontroller. We advise the Black Magic Probe.
* A computer with usb ports and your favorite text editor.

# Getting Started

When you want to start developing with a new microcontroller you need to get it working as soon as possible. That way you know that your hardware is sound and you can fully focus on learning all the microcontrollers ins and outs. 

## Get the hardware
Choose your micrcocontroller. Buy a suitable development board or two (in case you blow one up) and a debugger probe.

## Get the binaries
Find an existing blinky project and try it out. Easiest if there are binaries available that work on your specific board.

## Get the code
Try to get the code to build. Change some things and see if they have any effect.
